# Reflection

I won't lie. This project has been a surprisingly eye-opening experience. 
At first, the idea of building a whole program from scratch felt overwhelming, especially one with menus, classes, and also inheritance, especially and different features working together. 
But as I moved step by step, I started seeing how each part connected. I learned how classes work in a real program, not just in isolated exercises or on their own. 
Using inheritance to create Income and Expense objects helped me understand why object-oriented programming actually matters. 
I also learned the importance of structuring code so that it makes sense not only to the computer, but to me as the one writing it.

I think one of the biggest lessons I learned was to always check small details, because even tiny things can break the whole program. 
For example, the difference between “Income” and “income” caused hours of confusion, seriously. 
It taught me how careful Python is with exact matching, and how important validation and consistency are in programming. 
I also learned how much easier debugging becomes when I slow down, print values, and test one part at a time instead of panicking when I see all the red lines screaming, error, error, error.

I faced several challenges along the way. Getting the filter system to work correctly took a lot of patience, especially when working with date formats and matching categories. 
I think the summary method was also tricky because I had to calculate totals while tracking categories at the same time. 
Adding new features like the budget warning and undo function forced me to think differently about how the program flows. 
Sometimes I had to rewrite things I thought were already “finished,” and that taught me that revising your code is just part of the process.

If I had more time, I would improve this project by adding data persistence so the transactions don’t disappear after closing the program. 
I would also like to format the output more neatly, maybe using tables or colors to make it more readable.
Another improvement would be turning it into a web app in the future, because I can now see how this simple tracker could grow into something more useful.
Overall, I would say this project hasn’t just taught me Python—it has taught me patience, problem-solving, and how satisfying it feels when something finally works after a long struggle.
